class S3BucketPolicyPrincipalRule(PrincipalCheckingRule, ResourceSpecificRule):
    """
    Checks for non-allowed principals in S3 bucket policies.

    Risk:
        This is designed to block unintended access from third party accounts to your buckets.

    Fix:
        All principals connected to S3 Bucket Policies should be known. CFRipper checks that **all** principals meet
        the requirements expected. The list of valid accounts is defined in `valid_principals`, which is set in the config.
